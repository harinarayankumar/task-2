<h4 style="color:pink;">Web Dev Projects</h4>
<p>I have worked on a web project.
I have created a simple web development project consisting of three HTML pages: an introduction, college details, and a project showcase.
The website includes a navigation menu for easy access between pages and uses basic CSS for styling. It highlights my education, skills, and internship experience, providing a structured and informative layout.</p>

<h5 style="color:pink;">skill</h5>
<p>I have developed a variety of skills that allowed me to apply my technical and creative skills in web development.
In this project, I designed and developed a fully functional website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the front end, along with basic backend.</p>
